        "question": "How does the phenomenon mainly introduced in the video happen?\nA. Fluctuations in income levels directly determine the availability of credit, which in turn impacts spending patterns and overall economic activity.\nB. Credit availability remains constant, while changes in spending habits and income levels create short-term fluctuations within a stable economic environment.\nC. Government policies and central bank interventions are the primary drivers of economic cycles, with spending, income, and credit playing a secondary role.\nD. Increased spending leads to higher incomes, encouraging further borrowing. Conversely, decreased spending reduces incomes resulting in a contraction.",
